# CS-Playground-React: Algos & Data Structures (work in progress)

An interactive overview of common sorting algorithms and data structures, implemented in JavaScript. Also includes several other miscellaneous algorithm challenges, similar to those asked in programming interviews. This is intended to help you brush up on your computer science fundamentals, algorithm, and problem solving skills as you prepare for interviews.

__This is meant as a reference / review only &mdash; if you haven't already learned / solved these problems on your own, I recommend giving them a try in the editor first before looking at the solution code! If you get stuck, there are plenty of resources accessible right through the app to help you along. A full list of resources can also be found [here](https://github.com/no-stack-dub-sack/cs-playground-react/blob/master/RESOURCES.md)__

This project uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) and [React-CodeMirror](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-codemirror/) to embed an editor into the browser, and a hack that hijacks the console's messages to output messages into a mock console so that you can see the code's output without having the browser's devtools open.

The live site is currently running here: https://cs-playground-react.surge.sh/

## Contents:
### Sorting Algorithms:
- Quicksort
- Mergesort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Heap Sort
- Sorting Algorithm Benchmarks

### Data Structures:
- Stack

- Binary Search Tree
- Max Heap
- Hash Table

### Algorithm Challenges
**Easy:**
- Sum All Primes
- Is Palindrome _(coming soon)_
- Fizz Buzz _(coming soon)_

**Moderate/Difficult:**
- No Two Consecutive Chars
- Anagram Palindrome
- Sum Prime Factors _(coming soon)_
- Rotate An Image _(coming soon)_
- Sum Prime Factors _(coming soon)_

## To Install/Run:
- Fork repo, clone locally, and run `npm install` or `yarn install`
- In the root directory, run `yarn start` or `npm start`

## \*\*_Challenge!_
Some of my solutions are less than perfect. If you come up with a better one, or want to add a new algorithm or data structure that I haven't covered, feel free to submit a PR!
